		<h1>The Bookstore wants your $$$</h1>
		<p>
			Do you hate spending hundreds of dollars every semester on textbooks, and when it's time to sell them back, they will only give you <strong>$20 bucks?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Does your professor require that you purchase a "special edition" textbook that he/she wrote himself? And you can't even sell it back because there's a "new edition" coming out?
		</p><br >
		<h2>Sell your books to fellow UMaine Students</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>It's easy, just post your book.</strong> If someone is interested in your book, they will email you and setup an exchange on campus. There's no middleman, so you get the maximum price for your book.
